GitHub Flavored Markdown
================================

Let's get the whole "linebreak" thing out of the way. The next paragraph contains two phrases separated by a single newline character:

Roses are red
Violets are blue

The next paragraph has the same phrases, but now they are separated by two spaces and a newline character:

Roses are red  
Violets are blue

Oh, and one thing I cannot stand is the mangling of words with multiple underscores in them like perform_complicated_task or do_this_and_do_that_and_another_thing.
